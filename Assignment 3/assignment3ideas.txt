I have two ideas for my website this semester:

1. Stardew Valley Crop Planner
    A website that fans of the farming game Stardew Valley can use to keep
    track of what crops they planted and when they will be ready to be
    harvested. They will be able to save their stats and crop plans so
    they can revisit them in order to use them again!

2. Dream Journal Blog
    A blog where users can sign up and post their dreams to their own blog
    in order to keep track of and share them. Users will also have access
    to an explore page where they can see other users' blogs!

I'd love to hear which website you think would be better to create!
